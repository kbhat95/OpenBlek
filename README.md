# OpenBlek

Course project in Computer Graphics, inspired by Blek for iPhone.

## Objective

The goal is simple. Shape a line that collects all red circles avoiding black holes on its route. There are no specific moves that you need to master. To every level countless elegant solutions exist, from delightfully simple to exceptionally deep and complex.

## Rules

* The drawn line reflects off of the left and right boundaries of the screen.
* If the drawn line crosses the upper or lower boundaries, the level is reset and the user can draw again.
* The user is free to draw a new line whenever he/she chooses to.

## Prerequisites

* *nix operating system, preferably Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and its dependencies

## Running

In the root of the game directory, type `make`.

To run the game, type `./game`.
